Hello, and welcome to my small corner of the internet!

In this video, I introduce myself and this channel, paving the way for all my future videos. It was ment to serve as an 'opening' video, announceing that I wanted to build this YouTube channel after last year's unexpected succes of [Is the GMKtec NucBox5 Dead or Alive After 1 Year?](https://youtu.be/3xebrmU7vVk), with the video getting over 12K views! I was only expecting 1 or 2 hundres!
